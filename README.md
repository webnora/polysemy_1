**Abstract.** In the present paper we aim to compute the correlation between the two linguistic parameters in Old English, the word length and lexical polysemy to show the dynamics of form-meaning correlation at earlier stages of language development. We analyze the datasets with the /w/ and /s/ onsets extracted from A Thesaurus of Old English employing Pearson, Spearman, and Kendall correlation coefficients. Our findings provide evidence for strong quantitative relationship between the form and content of linguistics units in Old English that contributes to the study of synergetic linguistics. The results confirm the hypothesis that such linguistic parameter of lexical semantics as polysemy influences the word length and that both word form and polysemy are subject to mutual correlation. In the process of language development, lexical units tend to preserve form and content required for successful communication.
